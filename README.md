# All-Punjab-Universities-Dashboard-
In this project, We led the effort to gather stakeholder requirements through 59 survey responses, ensuring that the dashboard was closely aligned with user needs for comprehensive functionality. We resolved 4 major conflicting requirements to achieve universal usability across different user groups. Additionally, I was responsible for designing, developing, and iteratively refining prototypes for the "All Punjab Universities" dashboard. This process included the creation of 3 personas and extensive user testing, which significantly enhanced the overall functionality and user experience.

Here is low fidelity Prototype:
